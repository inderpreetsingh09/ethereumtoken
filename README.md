MyToken Solidity Smart Contract
Overview
The MyToken smart contract is a basic implementation of an ERC20-like token on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes functionalities for minting and burning tokens, allowing for flexible control over the total supply. This project serves as an introduction to writing, deploying, and interacting with smart contracts using Solidity and Remix IDE.

Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate the creation of a custom token on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes basic operations that are fundamental to most token contracts:

Defining token properties such as name, symbol, and total supply.
Maintaining balances for each address.
Allowing the minting of new tokens.
Allowing the burning of existing tokens.
Functionality
Public Variables
name: The name of the token.
symbol: The symbol or abbreviation of the token.
totalSupply: The total supply of tokens in existence.
balances: A mapping that keeps track of each address's balance.
Mint Function
mint(address account, uint256 amount): Increases the total supply of tokens by the specified amount and credits the specified address with the same amount.
Burn Function
burn(address account, uint256 amount): Decreases the total supply of tokens by the specified amount and debits the specified address with the same amount. It includes a check to ensure that the address has enough tokens to burn.
Deployment and Usage
Prerequisites
Access to Remix IDE
Basic understanding of Solidity and smart contracts
